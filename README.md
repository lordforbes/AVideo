## Your Comprehensive Video Streaming Solution

At AVideo, we provide more than just a platform; we offer a comprehensive solution for hosting, managing, monetizing, and expanding your video content. Embrace the future of video streaming and unlock the full potential of your content with AVideo. 

# üìö How AVideo is Organized

AVideo is a comprehensive platform, divided into three key components:

- **Streamer**: The core component for playing and managing videos. It acts as the main interface for users to interact with video content.
- **Encoder**: This tool converts your videos into a web-compatible format, ensuring they are ready for streaming on various devices and platforms.
- **Live Server**: Specifically designed for broadcasting live videos, this component is essential for real-time streaming capabilities.

## üîç Why Do I Need the Encoder?

Installing your own encoder can be beneficial for several reasons:

- **Faster Performance**: Having your own encoder might provide faster processing compared to using a public encoder server.
- **Privacy**: If privacy in video processing is a concern, a private encoder ensures that your content remains confidential.
- **Network Compatibility**: In cases where your server is on a private network without a public IP address or uses an IP within specific ranges (10.0.0.0/8, 127.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16), having your own encoder is essential for proper communication with the streamer site.

## üìú Agreement on the Purpose of Software Installation

AVideo is dedicated to promoting positive and ethical content creation. As such, we firmly stipulate that:

- This Software must be used for Good, never for Evil.
- The creation of content related to sexually explicit material, pornography, or adult themes using this software is strictly prohibited.

# Crucial Advisory: Strictly Avoid Using Control Panels for Installation

**Important**: For the installation of the Streamer, Encoder, and Livestream components, it is imperative to use a Linux distribution, specifically Ubuntu, **without any type of control panel**. This includes avoiding panels like cPanel, Plesk, Webmin, VestaCP, and similar.

Control panels significantly interfere with the necessary system access and processes required for a successful installation. They restrict the installation of essential libraries and the compilation of critical software, such as Nginx for the Livestream component.

**Please be advised**: Installing our system on a server with any control panel is highly discouraged and is likely to result in installation failure. We cannot provide support or guarantee success in such scenarios. For a smooth and functional installation, it is essential to follow this guideline strictly.
